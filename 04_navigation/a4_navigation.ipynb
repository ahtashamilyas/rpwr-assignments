It is not graded, but contains helpful material for working with sensors and sending commands. Start with the `office.ipynb` to create a Gazebo sim online. Then move on to the `sensors.ipynb` for understanding the laserscan before solving this Assignment."

    "## Local System Setup\n",
    "(Courtesy by Kishan Ravindra Sawant)\n",
    "- Create a new workspace (e.g., named `ros2_ws`) where you'll clone or develop all your ROS packages. Inside this workspace, create a folder named `src/`. Then, from within the `src/` directory, clone the following repositories,\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/secorolab/create3_sim.git\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/secorolab/turtlebot4.git\n",

    "```\n",
    "- From the root of your workspace (i.e., ros2_ws/), build the workspace by executing `colcon build --allow-overriding $(colcon list --names-only)`\n",
    "- **Note:** Generally `colcon build` is sufficient to build the packages, but as some of these are also included in the *underlay* workspace, they should be explicitly built with the flag *--allow-overriding*\n",
    "- Every time you build the workspace, you need to **source** it so that your terminal session can recognize the linked libraries. To do this, execute `source install/setup.bash` from the root of your workspace\n",
